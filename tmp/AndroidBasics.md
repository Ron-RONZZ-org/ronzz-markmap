# Emulated Storage

On Android&derivatives, apps and user files are isolated from system core via emulated storage. Emulated storage is essentially a folder within the system disk with its own file table (as opposed to a separate partition or disk on Linux). This simultaneously permits decent system isolation and usage of all available disk space. emulated storage is usually mapped as  `/storage/emulated/0/`
