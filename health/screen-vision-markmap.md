# Screen Vision

## Screen time impact

- Modern life
  - Screens dominate daily activities
  - Vision may suffer
  - Children particularly affected

## Myopia epidemic

- Short-sightedness rising
  - Incidence increasing worldwide
  - Optometrists noting epidemic in children
  - Genetics alone can't explain
- Projections
  - By 2050: Half the world near-sighted
- Evidence
  - Genetic component exists
  - Prevalence increased dramatically
  - Too rapid for genetics alone
  - Environmental factors
    - Screen time likely risk factor
    - Especially in young children

## How myopia develops

- Eyeball development
  - Grows faster than normal
  - Becomes too long
  - Distance vision blurs
- Irreversible
  - Once set in, permanent
  - Correctable but not reversible
- Modern treatments
  - Orthokeratology
    - Contact lenses at night
    - Temporarily reshape eyeball
    - Slows progression
    - Doesn't reverse myopia
  - Can be expensive

## Serious risks

- Lifetime consequences
  - Higher risk of
    - Glaucoma
    - Retinal detachment
    - Cataract
    - Myopic macular degeneration
    - Potential blindness
- Eyeball can't shrink back
  - Vision correctable
  - Risks remain
- Prevention best strategy

## Short-term effects

- Eye strain
- Dry eyes
- Tired eyes
- Reduced blinking
  - Halved rates within first minute
  - Main lubrication mechanism
  - Protection mechanism
- Long-term impacts
  - Concerns about prolonged device use
  - Potential unknown effects

## Protecting eyes

### Screen time limits

- WHO guidelines
  - School-age children: < 2 hours/day
  - Under 2: No screen time
- Reality
  - Few children meet recommendations

### Time outdoors

- Reduces myopia likelihood
  - Looking into distance
  - Wide-open spaces
  - Less near work
  - Less screen time
- Any duration works
  - Lunchtime
  - Walking to/from school
  - Office commute
- Won't slow progression
  - Once myopia sets in
- Sun protection
  - Wear sunglasses
  - Wear hat

### Ergonomic practices

- For adults using screens at work
- Proper workstation setup
  - Desktop screen
    - Appropriate distance
    - Proper height
  - Adequate natural lighting
  - Regular breaks
- 20-20-20 rule
  - Every 20 minutes
  - Look 20 meters away
  - For at least 20 seconds
