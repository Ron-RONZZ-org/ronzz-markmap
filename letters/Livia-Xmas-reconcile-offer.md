Hi,

Hope you are having a good Christmas.

I am moving out of Épinal 25th of January to start at UFR MIM in Metz. If between now and then at any point you feel like having a coffe/ taking a walk together, let me know.

I am now more able to understand why you left the relationship even though you enjoyed it to some degree. We do have different outlooks and expectations on romance and life in general, which was not an issue when we were friends, but more and more an issue as we grew closer. I was unconsciously trying to minimise those differences, at times by projecting my feelings onto you, which caused some illusions for myself. You broke those illusions as suddenly as one pops a bubble, and I was startled.

I had an extremely traumatic childhood (if you wonder why I chose to come back to France as an adult, distancing myself from my parents is a big part), and how the night unfolded reminded me of alot of things. I thought those traumas were behind me so I was not at all prepared when they all came back at once. It was more than what I could handle.

I still cherish the short amount of time that we were together. I really enjoyed chatting with you and you taught me so much randomm stuf. The breakup was a bit too strong but in a way it helpt me to take a critical look at myself and the life choices I am making for the first time in a very long time. Even though I am reluctant to admit it I have very strong people-pleasing tendencies, often to my own detriment. The way you respected your own feelings hurted me but also set an example for me. Apparently it takes a Brazilian to teach a Chinese to say no. 

Anyways merry Christmas.
