Hi,

Happy new year and I hope you have passed an amazing Christmas.

I am requesting this appointment as I am transferring to UFR-MIM Metz from IUT Épinal for S2. I need to find an accomodation starting around 26th January. As you can tell I am a French national, but since I grew up mostly abroad, there are particularities in my situation that are comparable to foreign students, such as the difficulty in convincing private landlords to rent to me, or filling out correctly a DSE for CROUS-logements, as both of my parents have settled abroad permanently and do not bother with French tax declarations anymore. Since the regular assistance workers for all students fail to advice me appropriately in view of my particular situation, it will be much appreciated if you can make time for a brief appointment with me.

PS : Je suis plus à l’aise en anglais qu’en français. Je vous écris en anglais car j’ai été informé que vous parlez cette langue.

Cordialement,
Rong ZHOU
