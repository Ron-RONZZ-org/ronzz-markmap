# markmap transform
Imitate the brief and succinct writing style in `example-markmap-en.md` and transform markdown files in `tmp/`  to markmaps in English, then put them into appropriate folders. 

- CS related : `science/computing/`
- life: `la-vie/`
- health: `health/`
- literature, religion: `humanities/`

and create a symlink for each one in `tmp-markmaps/` 

Name created files in the format of `{subject}-markmap.md` (all lower-case with `-` as word separator)
