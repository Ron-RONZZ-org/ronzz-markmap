- **Sudo**  
    - allows users to execute commands with elevated privileges without logging in directly as root  
        - ✅ **Enhanced security**  
            - enables disabling direct `root` login  
                - `root` is a common target for brute‑force attacks  
                    - because `root` exists on every Linux system by default  
                    - `sudo` avoids exposing the root account  
                    - This is also why default usernames like **“ubuntu”** should be changed  
            - logs all executed privileged commands  
            - no shared passwords between users  
        - ✅ **Flexibility**  
            - customizable configuration via **`/etc/sudoers`**  
            - fine‑grained access control
