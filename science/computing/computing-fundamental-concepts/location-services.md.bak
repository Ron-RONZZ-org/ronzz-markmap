# Location services

- cases for localisation
  - geographically-sensitive service
    - maps
      - route-planning
      - places nearby
        - restaurants
        - supermarkets
    - car hailing/food delivery apps
    - weather apps
  - targed ads
- strategies
  - approximate
    - cell tower

      - « The phone is the first thing that they will track ! »
  - precision
    - GPS

      - time-based distance determination
        - $\Delta t=t_{reception}-t_{timestamp\ at\ send}$
        - nano-second precision required
          - $E_d=E_t\cdot c$
          - 1ms error : 300 km deviation
            - automatic correction strategy
              - $ E_{t1}=E_{t2}=E_{t3}=E_{t4} $ 
              - atomic clocks on satellites have nanosecond precision
              - time drift on the requesting device's clock is the key source of imprecision
              - which identically affects each satellite ping  
              - correction : test-and-check compensation until single intersection

    - Wi-fi
      - similar to cell tower identification
        - pin-point position by intersection
      - much smaller reception area
        - improved accuracy
      - Wi-fi to location map
        - early days : effort by Google Street View team
        - today : automatic collection and upload on Android devices by default
- modern location services : multi-strategy approach
  - rural : GPS dominant
  - urban : celltower+Wifi dominant
